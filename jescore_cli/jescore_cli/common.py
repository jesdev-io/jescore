General baseline constants
--------------------------

`KNOWN_HOSTS`:                  Types of known MCUs and their HWIDs
`CLI_PREFIX_CLIENT`:            Prefix for messages coming from jescore. Visual only.
`CLI_PREFIX_MCU`                Prefix for the headless CLI (e.g. via putty). Acts as
                                termination of transaction when this CLI is used.
`CLI_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER`:        Prefix for the transmitted message to distinguish
                                between this CLI and the headless CLI.

"""
Client side flags
-----------------

`CMD_CLIENT_CONNECT_FLAG_PORT`: Flag only used on client side; won't be sent to jescore.
                                Used to let the user choose a COM/tty port:
                                `jescore <command> -p COM<x>`. If not used, the first
                                available port with a known host is used.
`CMD_CLIENT_FLAGS`:             List of known flags.

"""
Known responses from jescore
----------------------------

`RESPONSE_OK`:                  Standard response from jescore in case of successful transaction with no return string
`RESPONSE_ERR`:                 Standard response from jescore in case of an error during transactions
`RESPONSE_WARN`:                Standard response from jescore in case of a warning during transactions
`RESPONSE_RDY`:                 jescore is ready to receive some form of data or command
`RESPONSE_FNSH`:                jescore finished some sort of data transfer or job
`RESPONSE_TRX_OVER`:            jescore terminates the connection to this CLI

Misc stuff
----------
